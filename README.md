# Adobe killer

I'm tired of useless trash from Adobe, like then you're running PS lot's of junk starting executing, for example: creative cloud, cc helpers and so on. After closing PS this trash doesn't runaway, it's still running, so u need to kill it by urself, for this purpose I made simple bash script.
